/** The ProcessManager class is an interface to the MPI library, and is the only place in the SKIRT
    code where explicit calls to this library are allowed. A single instance of the ProcessManager
    class must be constructed just after program startup, and before the command-line arguments are
    used by other parts of the program. The latter is important because the MPI initialization
    functions called by the ProcessManager constructor may adjust the command-line arguments to
    remove MPI specific options. The program should not use the exit() or abort() functions, but
    rather let the main() function run to normal completion and return an exit code.

    The functions of this class should be called only from the main thread of the program.
    Violation of this rule causes undefined behavior that may differ between MPI implementations.
