/** Configuration is a helper class that serves as a central clearing house for overall simulation
    configuration options, including those offered by all members of the SimulationMode class
    hierarchy.

    Each MonteCarloSimulation holds a single Configuration object. During setup, it retrieves many
    properties and options from the simulation hierarchy, verifying consistency of the
    configuration and flagging any conflicts while doing so. Once this process has completed, the
    Configuration object offers getters for these retrieved properties to any of the other
    simulation items in the hierarchy. The setup() function of the Configuration object is invoked
    at the very early stages of simulation setup, so that it is safe for other simulation items to
    retrieve information from the Configuration object during setup.

    The Configuration class is based on SimulationItem so that it can be part of a simulation item
    hierarchy, however it is not discoverable because it is not intended to be selected or
    configured by the user. */
