        part of the SKIRT build tree in the source code repository, and then searches resource
        files installed in a directory next to (and thus outside of) the SKIRT build tree. This
        mechanism allows to provide small and frequently-used resource files as part of the source
        code repository, while requiring larger resource files to be downloaded seperately.

        Specifically, the function searches the following directories, and all nested
        subdirectories inside these directories, recursively:

        - the \c resources directory inside the SKIRT build tree.
        - the \c resources directory (if any) next to the SKIRT \c git directory (i.e. outside of
          the build tree).

        The top-level directories are searched in the order listed above. The search order for the
        nested directories inside the top-level directories is unspecified. The first occurrence of
        the specified filename terminates the search. If the function cannot locate the specified
        resource, a fatal error is thrown. */

        specified type and with a filename including the specified segments. The list of resources
        scanned by this function is the same as that described for the resource() function.

        For a resource to be considered by this function, the end of its filename (including the
        filename extension) must match the specified type string, and the filename must also
        contain each of the specified segments. If no resources or multiple resources match these
        requirements, the function throws a fatal error. If a single resource matches, the function
        returns its filename. */
