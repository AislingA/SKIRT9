/** The MonteCarloSimulation class is the top-level class describing a SKIRT simulation. Running a
    Monte Carlo simulation with SKIRT essentially comes down to constructing an instance of the
    MonteCarloSimulation class and invoking the setupAndRun() function on it. The
    MonteCarloSimulation class holds the source, media, instrument and probe systems, implements
    the core aspects of the photon packet life-cycle, and manages the iterative processes in the
    simulation (including phases, iterations and segments).

    The user-configurable \em SimulationMode enumeration sets the overall simulation mode. It
    determines the simulation's wavelength regime (oligochromatic or panchromatic) and the required
    simulation segments (e.g., extinction only or including secondary emission). The
    runSimulation() function performs all segments of the simulation, calling the
    runPrimaryEmission(), runDustSelfAbsorptionPhase(), and runSecondaryEmission() functions as
    required. These functions in turn invoke the performLifeCycle() function to trace photon
    packets through their complete life cycle, including emission, multiple forced scattering
    events, peel-off towards the instruments, and registration of the contribution to the radiation
    field in each spatial cell crossed.

    The MonteCarloSimulation class also holds the non-discoverable \em config property, which is
    automatically set to an instance of the Configuration class. The setup() function of the config
    object is invoked at the very early stages of overall simulation setup, so that it can
    initialize its internal state to reflect the simulation configuration. As a result, it is safe
    for other simulation items to retrieve information from the config object during setup. */

{
    /** The enumeration type indicating the simulation mode, which determines the overall structure
        of the simulation and its capabilities. The choice made for the simulation mode has a
        significant impact on which options are allowed or required in the simulation's
        configuration. For example, some basic simulation modes support just primary sources
        without any media.

        An important aspect determined by the simulation mode is the simulation's wavelength
        regime, which can be oligochromatic or panchromatic. Oligochromatic simulations use just a
        few pre-defined, discrete wavelengths. They do no support kinematics (moving sources and/or
        media) because the wavelengths cannot shift away from the pre-defined values, and they do
        not support secondary emission by the transfer medium because the radiation field must be
        known across a wide spectrum to calculate the medium state and the resulting emission.
        Panchromatic simulations use a continuous range of wavelengths, lifting these limitations.

        For panchromatic simulations, the simulation mode further determines fundamental choices
        such as whether to include secondary emission, and whether to iterate over the radiation
        field state to obtain self-consistent results taking into account, for example, dust
        self-absorption.

        The "extinction-only" simulation modes calculate the extinction of the primary radiation
        through the configured media, including the effects of absorption and scattering. There is
        no secondary emission, so these modes are meaningful only for wavelengths at which
        secondary sources (radiation from the media) can be neglected, i.e. in the ultraviolet,
        optical and near-infrared. Also, the media state is constant, i.e. it is initialized from
        the properties defined in the input model (density distributions, material properties) and
        is never updated. As a result, there is no need to store the radiation field during the
        photon packet life cycle. However, there is user-configurable option to store the radiation
        field anyway so that it can be probed for output.

        The "dust emission" simulation modes (which require a panchromatic wavelength range that
        includes optical to far-infrared regimes) include secondary emission from dust, in addition
        to the effects of absorption and scattering. In these modes, the simulation keeps track of
        the radation field (to calculate the dust emission) and optionally performs iterations to
        self-consistently calculate the effects of dust self-absorption. */

        radiation field in each spatial cell crossed.

        A photon packet is born when it is emitted by either the primary or the secondary source
        system. Immediately after birth, peel-off photon packets are created and launched towards
        the instruments (one for each instrument). If the simulation contains one or more media,

        of the path of the photon packet through the medium are calculated and stored. Based on
        this information, the contribution of the photon packet to the radiation field in each
        spatial cell can be stored. The packet is then propagated to a new (random) scattering
        position, and its weight (luminosity) is adjusted for the escape fraction and the absorbed
        energy. If the photon packet is still sufficiently luminous, scattering peel-off photon
        packets are created and launched towards each instrument, and the actual scattering event
        is simulated. Finally, the loop repeats itself. It is terminated only when the photon

        packet is subsequently fed into its target instrument for detection.

        A peel-off photon packet has the same characteristics as the original photon packet, except
        that the propagation direction is altered from the emission direction \f${\bf{k}}\f$ to the
        direction of the observer \f${\bf{k}}_{\text{obs}}\f$. For anisotropic emission, a weight

        probability that it is emitted in any other direction. If the source has a nonzero velocity,

        optical depth information for the photon packet's path have been set; if this is not the
        case, the behavior is undefined.

        The radiation field is discretized on the spatial grid of the simulation (held by the
        MediumSystem object) and on a wavelength grid provided specifically for this purpose (see
        the Configuration::radiationFieldWLG() function for more information). Locating the
        appropriate spatial bin is trivial because each segment in the photon packet's path stores
        the index of the cell being crossed. The wavelength bin is derived from the photon packet's
        perceived wavelength in the cell under consideration, taking into account the velocity
        of the medium in that cell.

        For each segment \f$n\f$ in the photon packet's path, this function first determines the
        corresponding spatial/wavelength bin as described above. To the contents of that bin, the
        function adds the product of the mean luminosity carried by the photon packet along the
        segment and the distance covered by the segment, or \f[ (L\Delta s)_n = L_{\text{mean},n}
        \,(\Delta s)_n = L\,\text{lnmean} \left(\text{e}^{-\tau_{n-1}}, \text{e}^{-\tau_n}\right)
        \,(\Delta s)_n \f] where \f$L\f$ is the luminosity carried by the photon packet,
        \f$\text{lnmean}()\f$ is the logarithmic mean, \f$\tau_{n-1}\f$ and \f$\tau_n\f$ represent
        the cumulative optical depth at the start and end of the segment, and \f$(\Delta s)_n\f$ is
        the distance covered by the segment. Using the logarithmic mean assumes an exponential
        behavior of the exinction with distance within the segment.

        Once this information has been accumulated for all photon packets launched during a segment
        of the simulation, the mean intensity of the radiation field in each spatial/wavelength bin
        can be calculated using \f[ (J_\lambda)_{\ell,m} = \frac{ (L\Delta s)_{\ell,m}
        }{4\pi\,V_m\,(\Delta \lambda)_\ell} \f] where \f$\ell\f$ is the index of the wavelength
        bin, \f$(\Delta \lambda)_\ell\f$ is the wavelength bin width, \f$m\f$ is the spatial cell
        index, \f$V_m\f$ is the volume of the cell, and \f$(L\Delta s)_{\ell,m}\f$ has been
        accumulated over all photon packets contributing to the bin. The resulting mean intensity
        \f$J_\lambda\f$ is expressed as an amount of energy per unit of time, per unit of area, per
        unit of wavelength, and per unit of solid angle. */

    /** This function determines the next scattering location of a photon packet in a photon life

        assumes that both the geometric and optical depth information for the photon packet's path
        have been set; if this is not the case, the behavior is undefined. This function proceeds
        in a number of steps as outlined below.

        <b>Total optical depth</b>

        We first determine the total optical depth \f$\tau_\text{path}\f$ of the photon packet's
        path. Because the path has been calculated until the edge of the simulation's spatial grid,
        \f$\tau_\text{path}\f$ is equal to the cumulative optical depth at the end of the last
        segment in the path.

        <b>%Random optical depth</b>

        We then randomly generate the optical depth \f$\tau\f$ at the interaction site from an
        appropriate distribution. Given the total optical depth along the path of the photon packet
        \f$\tau_\text{path}\f$, the appropriate probability distribution for the covered optical
        depth is an exponential probability distribution cut off at \f$\tau_\text{path}\f$.
        Properly normalized, it reads as \f[ p(\tau) = \frac{{\text{e}}^{-\tau}}
        {1-{\text{e}}^{-\tau_\text{path}}} \f] where the range of \f$\tau\f$ is limited to the
        interval \f$[0,\tau_\text{path}]\f$. Instead of generating a random optical depth
        \f$\tau\f$ directly from this distribution, we use the biasing technique in order to cover
        the entire allowed optical depth range \f$[0,\tau_\text{path}]\f$ more uniformly. As the
        biased probability distribution, we use a linear combination between an exponential
        distribution and a uniform distribution, with a parameter \f$\xi\f$ setting the relative
        importance of the uniform part. In formula form, \f[ q(\tau) = (1-\xi)\, \frac{
        {\text{e}}^{-\tau} } { 1-{\text{e}}^{-\tau_\text{path}} } + \frac{\xi}{\tau_\text{path}}.
        \f] A random optical depth from this distribution is readily determined. Since we use
        biasing, the weight, or correspondingly the luminosity, of the photon packet needs to be
        adjusted with a bias factor \f$p(\tau)/q(\tau)\f$.

        <b>Interaction point</b>

        Now that the optical depth \f$\tau\f$ at the interaction site has been (randomly) chosen,
        we determine the physical position of the interaction point along the path. This is
        accomplished in two steps: a binary search among the path segments to determine the segment
        (or cell) "containing" the given cumulative optical depth, and subsequent linear
        interpolation within the cell assuming exponential behavior of the extinction.

        <b>Albedo</b>

        We calculate the scattering albedo \f$\varpi\f$ of the medium at the interaction point (or
        more precisely, for the spatial cell containing the interaction point).

        <b>Weight adjustment</b>

        We adjust the weight of the photon packet to compensate for the escaped and absorbed
        portions of the luminosity. More precisely, the weight is multiplied by the scattered
        fraction, i.e. the fraction of the luminosity that does not escape and does not get
        absorbed, \f[ f_\text{sca} = (1-f_\text{esc}) \,\varpi = (1-\text{e}^{-\tau_\text{path}})
        \,\varpi. \f]

        <b>Advance position</b>

        Finally we advance the initial position of the photon packet to the interaction point. This
        last step invalidates the photon packet's path (including geometric and optical depth
        information). The packet is now ready to be scattered into a new direction. */
    void simulateForcedPropagation(PhotonPacket* pp);

    /** This function simulates the propagation of a photon packet to the next scattering location
        in a photon life cycle without forced scattering. The function assumes that the next
        scattering location for the photon packet's path has already been set; if this is not the
        case, the behavior is undefined. This function proceeds in a number of steps as outlined
        below.

        <b>%Random optical depth</b>

        Because the photon packet is allowed to escape the model, we randomly generate the optical
        depth \f$\tau\f$ at the interaction site from the regular exponential distribution. The
        current implementation does not support path length biasing.

        <b>Interaction point</b>

        Now that the optical depth \f$\tau\f$ at the interaction site has been (randomly) chosen,
        we determine the physical position of the interaction point along the path. This is
        accomplished by generating the path segments for crossed cells one by one and calculating
        the corresponding cumulative optical depth on the fly. Once the cumulative optical depth at
        the exit point of a segment exceeds the interaction optical depth, we know that the
        interaction point must be within this segment. The physical interaction point is then
        obtained through linear interpolation within the segment, assuming exponential behavior of
        the extinction. If the cumulative optical depth of the path never exceeds the interaction
        optical depth, the photon packet escapes and is terminated.

        <b>Albedo</b>

        We calculate the scattering albedo \f$\varpi\f$ of the medium at the interaction point (or
        more precisely, for the spatial cell containing the interaction point).

        <b>Weight adjustment</b>

        We adjust the weight of the photon packet to compensate for the absorbed portion of the
        luminosity. More precisely, the weight is multiplied by the scattered fraction, i.e. \f$
        f_\text{sca} = \varpi \f$.

        <b>Advance position</b>

        Finally we advance the initial position of the photon packet to the interaction point. This
        last step invalidates the photon packet's path (including geometric and optical depth
        information). The packet is now ready to be scattered into a new direction. */

        observer instead of in the propagation direction determined randomly by the scattering
        process. Each peel-off photon packet is subsequently fed into its target instrument for
        detection.

        A peel-off photon packet has the same characteristics as the original photon packet, apart
        from four differences. The first one is, obviously, that the propagation direction is
        altered to the direction towards the observer. The second difference is that we have to
        alter the luminosity of the photon packet to compensate for this change in propagation
        direction, because the scattering process is anisotropic. The third difference is that the
        polarization state of the peel-off photon packet is adjusted. And the last difference is
        that the wavelength of the peel-off photon packet is properly Doppler-shifted taking into
        account the bulk velocity of the medium.

        The first argument to this function specifies the photon packet that is about to be
        scattered; the second argument provides a placeholder peel off photon packet for use by the
        function. */
