/** Source is an abstract class representing a primary radiation source in the simulation.
    Each source (an instance of a Source subclass) must define the following information at each
    point in the spatial domain of the source (which is independent of the spatial grid in the
    simulation):
      - The spectral energy distribution (SED) of the emission averaged over the unit sphere.
      - Some normalization for the luminosity (e.g., bolometric, at a given wavelength, ...).
      - If the emission is anisotropic, the rest-frame angular distribution of the emission.
      - If the emission is polarized, the polarization state of the emission in each direction.
      - The bulk velocity of the source relative to the model coordinate frame.

    Furthermore, each source has a function for launching a photon packet that proceeds roughly
    as follows:
      - Sample a location from the spatial density distribution.
      - Sample a wavelength from the SED at that location.
      - Determine the corresponding (possibly biased) luminosity weight
      - Determine the rest-frame angular distribution of the emission at that location and at
        that wavelength, i.e. an object offering the AngularDistribution interface (functions
        to return a random direction, and to return the probability for a given direction)
      - Determine the polarization state of the emission at that location and at that wavelength,
        i.e. an object offering the PolarizationState interface (function to return a Stokes vector
        given a propagation direction)
      - Determine the bulk velocity of the source at that location
      - Pass the items listed above to the photon packet launch procedure
