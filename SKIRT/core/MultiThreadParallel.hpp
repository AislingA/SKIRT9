/** This class implements the Parallel base class interface using multiple execution threads in a
    single process.

    When an exception is thrown by one of the threads excuting the target function, all other
    threads are gracefully shut down and a FatalError exception is thrown in the context of the
    thread that invoked the call() function. If the original exception was a FatalError instance,
    the newly thrown exception is a copy thereof. Otherwise a fresh FatalError instance is created
    with a generic error message.

    This class uses the standard low-level C++ multi-threading capabilities. It is designed to
    minimize the run-time overhead for handing out parallel tasks. Between invocations of the
    call() function, the parallel threads are put in wait so that they consume no CPU cycles (and
    very little memory).
