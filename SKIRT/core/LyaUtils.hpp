/** This namespace offers utility functions related to the treatment of Lyman-alpha (Lya) line
    transfer.

    When a Lya photon is absorbed by a neutral hydrogen atom in the ground state, the atom is
    excited to the 2p energy level and a new Lya photon is emitted almost immediately as a result
    of the subsequent downward transition. This happens fast enough that we can consider the
    combined process as a scattering event.

    The cross section for a single hydrogen atom of the Lya scattering of a photon can be derived
    using quantum mechanical considerations, resulting in a sharply peaked profile as a function of
    the photon wavelength in the atom's rest frame. Because each atom has its own velocity, a
    photon with a given wavelength in the gas rest frame will appear Doppler shifted to a slightly
    different wavelength for each atom in the gas. To compute the Lya absorption cross section for
    a collection of moving atoms, we must therefore convolve the single-atom cross section with the
    atom velocity distribution, which in turn depends on the gas temperature.

    Assuming a Maxwell-Boltzmann velocity distribution, we define the characteristic thermal
    velocity \f$v_\mathrm{th}\f$ as \f[ v_\mathrm{th} = \sqrt{\frac{2 k_\mathrm{B}
    T}{m_\mathrm{p}}} \f] where \f$k_\mathrm{B}\f$ is the Boltzmann constant, \f$m_\mathrm{p}\f$ is
    the proton mass, and \f$T\f$ is the temperature of the gas. We then introduce the dimensionless
    frequency variable \f$x\f$, defined as \f[ x = \frac{\nu - \nu_\alpha}{\nu_\alpha}
    \,\frac{c}{v_\mathrm{th}} = \frac{v_\mathrm{p}}{v_\mathrm{th}} \f]

    where \f$\nu=c/\lambda\f$ is the regular frequency variable, \f$\nu_\alpha=c/\lambda_\alpha\f$
    is the frequency at the Lya line center, \f$\lambda_\alpha\f$ is the wavelength at the Lya line
    center, and \f$c\f$ is the speed of light in vacuum. The last equality introduces the velocity
    shift \f$v_\mathrm{p}\f$ of the photon frequency relative to the Lya line center, defined by
    \f[ \frac{v_\mathrm{p}}{c} = \frac{\nu - \nu_\alpha}{\nu_\alpha} \approx -\frac{\lambda -
    \lambda_\alpha}{\lambda_\alpha} \f] where the approximate equality holds for \f$v_\mathrm{p}\ll
    c\f$.

    After neglecting some higher order terms, the convolution of the single-atom profile with the
    Maxwell-Boltzmann velocity distribution yields the following expression for the
    velocity-weighted Lya scattering cross section \f$\sigma_\alpha(x,T)\f$ of a hydrogen atom in
    gas at temperature \f$T\f$ as a function of the dimensionless photon frequency \f$x\f$: \f[
    \sigma_\alpha(x,T) = \sigma_{\alpha,0}(T)\,H(a_\mathrm{v}(T),x) \f] where the cross section at
    the line center \f$\sigma_{\alpha,0}(T)\f$ is given by \f[ \sigma_{\alpha,0}(T) =
    \frac{3\lambda_\alpha^2 a_\mathrm{v}(T)}{2\sqrt{\pi}}, \f] the Voigt parameter
    \f$a_\mathrm{v}(T)\f$ is given by \f[ a_\mathrm{v}(T) = \frac{A_\alpha}{4\pi\nu_\alpha}
    \,\frac{c}{v_\mathrm{th}} \f] with \f$A_\alpha\f$ the Einstein A-coefficient of the Lya
    transition; and the Voigt function \f$H(a_\mathrm{v},x)\f$ is defined by \f[ H(a_\mathrm{v},x)
    = \frac{a_\mathrm{v}}{\pi} \int_{-\infty}^\infty \frac{\mathrm{e}^{-y^2} \,\mathrm{d}y}
    {(y-x)^2+a_\mathrm{v}^2} \f] which is normalized so that \f$H(a_\mathrm{v},0) = 1\f$. */

    /** This function returns the emission wavelength range for which the photon packet life cycle
        should handle Lyman-alpha line transfer (if the simulation configuration includes
        Lyman-alpha line transfer), or in other words, the wavelength range outside of which a
        photon packet can never be Doppler shifted to a wavelength that is sufficiently near the
        Lyman-alpha line center to experience a significant cross section. Photon packets with a
        rest-frame emission wavelength outside of the range can be handled by the dust-only photon
        cycle, avoiding the expensive calculation of the Lyman-alpha scattering cross section for
        each cell crossed by the packet.

        The relevant wavelength range, or equivalently, the photon packet velocity shift
        \f$v_\mathrm{p}^*\f$ corresponding to this wavelength range, can be written as the sum of
        two components, \f[ v_\mathrm{p}^* = v_\mathrm{p,bulk}^* + v_\mathrm{p,Voigt}^*. \f]

        The first component represents the largest possible Doppler-shift from the emission
        wavelength in the rest frame of the source to the perceived wavelength in the rest frame of
        the gas caused by the bulk velocities of the sources and the media in the model. It can be
        estimated from the input model through \f[ v_\mathrm{p,bulk}^* =
        \max(||\bf{v}_\mathrm{source}||) + \max(||\bf{v}_\mathrm{medium}||). \f]

        The second component represents the velocity shift corresponding to the point where the
        Lyman-alpha scattering cross section profile (in the rest frame of the gas) dips below a
        particular value that can be considered to be negligible. We determine this cross section
        value by requiring that the optical depth of any path through the simulation domain at this
        cross section is below a certain (arbitrarily chosen) optical depth \f$\tau^*\f$. Given the
        maximum column density \f$\mathcal{N}^*\f$ through the simulation domain, which can be
        estimated from the input model through the maximum hydrogen number density and the maximum
        path length, we can write this requirement using the definition of the Lyman-alpha cross
        section as \f[ \tau^* = \mathcal{N}^* \,\sigma_{\alpha,0}\,H(a_\mathrm{v},x^*) \f] where
        \f$x^*\f$ is the dimensionless frequency shift to be calculated. Assuming that the required
        maximum optical depth \f$\tau^*\f$ is sufficiently low for \f$x^*\f$ to be in the wings of
        the Voigt profile, we can use the corresponding approximation of the Voigt profile. After
        substituting the definitions of the other quantities, we obtain \f[ v_\mathrm{p,Voigt}^* =
        \sqrt{\frac{3 A_\alpha^2 \lambda_\alpha^4}{64 \pi^3} \, \frac{\mathcal{N}^*}{\tau^*}}. \f]
        Interestingly, the dependence on temperature (hidden in \f$\sigma_{\alpha,0}\f$,
        \f$a_\mathrm{v}\f$ and \f$x^*\f$) has canceled out of this equation.

        The current implemenation uses \f$\tau^*=10^{-3}\f$.

        The function arguments are: the maximum source velocity magnitude, the maximum medium bulk
        velocity magnitude, the maximum hydrogen number density, and the maximum photon packet path
        length. */
