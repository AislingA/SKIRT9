/** DynamicStateRecipe is an abstract class representing recipes for dynamically adjusting the
    medium state by iterating over the radiation field. The purpose of the dynamic medium state
    mechanism is to allow self-consistent calculation of medium state variables. A prototypical
    example is the radiative destruction of dust grains.

    For each iteration step, the simulation launches a set of photon packets to track the radiation
    field based on the current values of the medium state variables. At the end of the iteration
    step, the dynamic medium state recipes configured for the simulation are given a chance to
    update the medium state variables based on the established radiation field. The iteration
    continues until all recipes indicate convergence (or the configured maximum number of
    iterations has been reached).

    At the end of each iteration step, the functions for each configured recipe are called in the
    following order: the beginUpdate() function; the update() function for each spatial cell and
    for each medium component in the simulation; and finally the endUpdate() function. The latter
    function also returns a Boolean that indicates whether the iteration can be considered to have
    converged for this recipe.

    A recipe is allowed to discover information about the configuration of the simulation during
    setup, for example to determine the type of material mixes associated with the various medium
    components. However, it should not update any information outside its own data members except
    through the material states passed to the update() function. Furthermore, the operation of the
    update function should solely depend on and affect changes to the material state passed to that
    particular invocation of the function. In other words, each spatial cell/component must be
    treated independently from other spatial cells/components.

    The functions for multiple recipes are invoked in the user-configured order for each particular
    cell (but may be otherwise interleaved in any order). Assuming two recipes A and B, configured
    in this order, recipe B will thus always see the state as it has been adjusted by recipe A.

    These requirements and guarantees allow the update() function to be called for different
    spatial cell/component combinations in parallel execution threads (and thus in arbitrary
    order). A possible execution sequence could be:

    \verbatim
    for r in recipes:
        r.beginUpdate()

    parallel for m in spatial cells:
        for r in recipes:
            for h in medium components:
                r.update(m, h)

    for r in recipes:
        r.endUpdate()
    \endverbatim
