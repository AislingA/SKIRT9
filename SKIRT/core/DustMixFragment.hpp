/** DustMixFragment is a helper class that represents a single grain population created by another
    dust mix. It is used by the FragmentDustMixDecorator class to represent a \em fragment of a
    MultiGrainDustMix instance.

    DustMixFragment itself inherits from MultiGrainDustMix as well, so that it can use the full
    power of this base class (albeit for just a single dust population). Although DustMixFragment
    indirectly inherits from SimulationItem, and thus can be part of the simulation hierarchy, its
    instances can only be constructed programmatically as opposed to being configured as part of a
    ski file. */

        grain population. The GrainPopulation object must be kept alive by the caller as long as
        the DustMixFragment instance lives.

        Before the constructor returns, the newly created object is hooked up as a child to the
        specified parent in the simulation hierarchy (so it will automatically be deleted), the
