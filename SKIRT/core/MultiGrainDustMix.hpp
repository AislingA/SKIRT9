        be tabulated. The output arrays and tables will already have the appropriate size
        (corresponding to the input wavelength grids) when the function gets called.

        For this class, this function integrates the optical properties over the grain size
        distribution for each of the grain populations added by a subclass, and stores the results
        into the corresponding output arrays. Also, the function returns the dust mass per hydrogen
        atom for the dust mix.

        the MaterialPhaseFunction scattering mode, the function fills only the first table and
        leaves the other tables untouched. For the SphericalPolarization scattering mode, the
        function fills all four tables. */

        scattering mode. Because there is no configuration option to choose between
        MaterialPhaseFunction or SphericalPolarization in this case, the current implementation
        never returns the MaterialPhaseFunction scattering mode.
