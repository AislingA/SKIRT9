/** MultiGrainDustMix is an abstract class implementing a dust mix described by one or more grain
    populations, each with their own grain composition and size distribution, and with or without
    support for polarization by scattering. The class offers facilities to its subclasses to add
    dust grain populations to the dust mix during initial setup. Subsequently, the class uses this
    list of grain populations to calculate the optical properties requested by the DustMix base
    class, and to implement the additional functionality offered by multi-grain-population dust
    mixes, such as providing the information needed for calculating emission from stochastically
    heated dust grains.

    All grain populations must have a level of Mueller matrix support that matches the value
    returned by the scatteringMode() function (which may be overridden in a subclass).
    Specifically, for the HenyeyGreenstein scattering mode, \em none of the grain populations
    should offer a Mueller matrix. For the MaterialPhaseFunction and SphericalPolarization
    scattering modes, \em all of the grain populations should offer a Mueller matrix. If this is
    not the case, a fatal error will result.

    <b>Calculating representative grain properties</b>

    The getOpticalProperties() function calculates the basic representative grain properties
    expected by the DustMix base class from the following information obtained from the dust grain
    populations added by the subclass: the absorption efficiencies \f$Q^{\text{abs}}(\lambda,a)\f$,
    the scattering efficiencies \f$Q^{\text{sca}}(\lambda,a)\f$, the scattering phase function
    asymmetry parameter \f$g(\lambda,a)\f$, the Mueller matrix coefficients
    \f$S^\text{xx}(\lambda,a,\theta)\f$, the bulk density \f$\rho_{\text{bulk}}\f$ of the grain
    material, and the properly normalized grain size distribution per hydrogen atom
    \f$\Omega(a)=(\frac{\text{d}n_\text{D}}{\text{d}a})/n_\text{H}\f$ in the range
    \f$[a_\text{min},a_\text{max}]\f$.

    The properties are calculated for each wavelength \f$\lambda_\ell\f$ in the wavelength grid
    specified by the DustMix class. The values are obtained by integrating over the grain size
    distribution \f$\Omega(a)\f$ using a builtin logarithmic grid and accumulating over all grain
    populations \f$c\f$, using the formulas listed below.

    The absorption and scattering cross sections per hydrogen atom
    \f$\varsigma_{\ell}^{\text{abs}}\f$ and \f$\varsigma_{\ell}^{\text{abs}}\f$ for the
    \f$\ell\f$'th wavelength are calculated using \f[ \varsigma_{\ell}^{\text{abs}} = \sum_c
    \int_{a_{\text{min},c}}^{a_{\text{max},c}} \Omega_c(a)\, Q^{\text{abs}}_c(\lambda_\ell,a)\, \pi
    a^2\, {\text{d}}a \f] and \f[ \varsigma_{\ell}^{\text{sca}} = \sum_c
    \int_{a_{\text{min},c}}^{a_{\text{max},c}} \Omega_c(a)\, Q^{\text{sca}}_c(\lambda_\ell,a)\, \pi
    a^2\, {\text{d}}a. \f]

    The Mueller matrix coefficients provided by the grain population are assumed to be expressed as
    a cross section (in arbitrary units). They are thus integrated over the size distribution
    without again multiplying by the grain cross section, i.e. using \f[
    S^\text{xx}_{\ell,\text{t}} = \sum_c \int_{a_{\text{min},c}}^{a_{\text{max},c}} \Omega_c(a)\,
    S^\text{xx}_c(\lambda_\ell,a,\theta_\text{t})\, {\text{d}}a \f]

    The representative asymmetry parameter \f$g_{\ell}\f$ is averaged over the scattering cross
    section and thus calculated using \f[ g_{\ell} = \frac{1}{\varsigma_{\ell}^{\text{sca}}} \sum_c
    \int_{a_{\text{min},c}}^{a_{\text{max},c}} \Omega_c(a)\, g_c(\lambda_\ell,a)\,
    Q^{\text{sca}}_c(\lambda_\ell,a)\, \pi a^2\, {\text{d}}a. \f]

    The dust mass per hydrogen atom \f$\mu\f$ is calculated by integrating the bulk density over
    the size distribution, \f[ \mu = \sum_c \int_{a_{\text{min},c}}^{a_{\text{max},c}}
    \Omega_c(a)\, \rho_{\text{bulk},c}\, \frac{4\pi}{3}\, a^3\, {\text{d}}a. \f]

    <b>Supporting dust emission calculations</b>

    The representative grain properties described above and offered by the public MaterialMix
    interface supported by this class are insufficient to accurately calculate dust emission
    spectra for the dust mixture. This is so because the emission spectrum is a nonlinear function
    of (among many other things) the grain size, and thus a single grain cannot accurately
    represent a population with a (potentialy large) range of grain sizes. Furthermore, smaller
    dust grains are often not in local thermal equilibrium, and instead are heated stochastically
    by individual photon absorption events. Modeling emission for these grains involves a
    temperature probability distribution rather than just an equilibrium temperature. The
    calculation needs calorimetric properties of the grain material in addition to optical
    properties.

    It is numerically intractable to handle every possible grain size seperately. Instead, the
    MultiGrainDustMix class discretizes the grain size distribution for each type of grain material
    into a number of consecutive size bins (on a logarithmic scale), and calculates the optical and
    calorimetric properties of a representative grain for each of these bins. The number of bins
    for each type of grain material can be configured by the user. A larger number of bins improves
    the accuracy of the dust emission spectra. On the other hand, the calculation time scales
    roughly linearly with the number of bins.

    The MultiGrainDustMix class offers a set of public functions on top of the regular MaterialMix
    public interface to expose information about the individual grain populations \f$c\f$ and the
    size-discretized bins \f$b\f$ as described above. For now, these functions are declared and
    implemented here. Over time they might be declared as part of a seperate interface, so that
    they might also be implemented by other MaterialMix subclasses (such as perhaps a material mix
    including both hydrogen gas and dust).

    As a result, the MultiGrainDustMix class supports the folowing methods for calculating dust
    emissivity with varying levels of accuracy:

    - using a single representative grain and assuming local thermal equilibrium

    - using multiple representative grains, one for each composition/size bin, still assuming local
    thermal equilibrium for each bin

    - using multiple representative grains without assuming local thermal equilibrium, i.e.
    calculating a temperature probability distribution to take into account stochastically heated
    grains.
