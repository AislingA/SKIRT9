/** MultiGrainDustMix is an abstract class implementing a dust mix described by one or more grain
    populations, each with their own grain composition and size distribution, and with or without
    support for polarization by scattering. The class offers facilities to its subclasses to add
    dust grain populations to the dust mix during initial setup. Subsequently, the class uses this
    list of grain populations to calculate the optical properties requested by the DustMix base
    class, and to implement the additional functionality offered by multi-grain-population dust
    mixes, such as providing the information needed for calculating emission from stochastically
    heated dust grains.

    <b>Calculating representative grain properties</b>

    The getOpticalProperties() function calculates the basic representative grain properties
    expected by the DustMix base class from the following information obtained from the dust grain
    populations added by the subclass: the absorption efficiencies \f$Q^{\text{abs}}(\lambda,a)\f$,
    the scattering efficiencies \f$Q^{\text{sca}}(\lambda,a)\f$, the scattering phase function
    asymmetry parameter \f$g(\lambda,a)\f$, the Mueller matrix coefficients
    \f$S^\text{xx}(\lambda,a,\theta)\f$, the bulk density \f$\rho_{\text{bulk}}\f$ of the grain
    material, and the properly normalized grain size distribution per hydrogen atom
    \f$\Omega(a)=(\frac{\text{d}n_\text{D}}{\text{d}a})/n_\text{H}\f$ in the range
    \f$[a_\text{min},a_\text{max}]\f$.

    The properties are calculated for each wavelength \f$\lambda_\ell\f$ in the wavelength grid
    specified by the DustMix class. The values are obtained by integrating over the grain size
    distribution \f$\Omega(a)\f$ using a builtin logarithmic grid and accumulating over all grain
    populations \f$c\f$, using the formulas listed below.

    The absorption and scattering cross sections per hydrogen atom
    \f$\varsigma_{\ell}^{\text{abs}}\f$ and \f$\varsigma_{\ell}^{\text{abs}}\f$ for the
    \f$\ell\f$'th wavelength are calculated using \f[ \varsigma_{\ell}^{\text{abs}} = \sum_c
    \int_{a_{\text{min},c}}^{a_{\text{max},c}} \Omega_c(a)\, Q^{\text{abs}}_c(\lambda_\ell,a)\, \pi
    a^2\, {\text{d}}a \f] and \f[ \varsigma_{\ell}^{\text{sca}} = \sum_c
    \int_{a_{\text{min},c}}^{a_{\text{max},c}} \Omega_c(a)\, Q^{\text{sca}}_c(\lambda_\ell,a)\, \pi
    a^2\, {\text{d}}a. \f]

    The Mueller matrix coefficients provided by the grain population are assumed to be expressed as
    a cross section (in arbitrary units). They are thus integrated over the size distribution
    without again multiplying by the grain cross section, i.e. using \f[
    S^\text{xx}_{\ell,\text{t}} = \sum_c \int_{a_{\text{min},c}}^{a_{\text{max},c}} \Omega_c(a)\,
    S^\text{xx}_c(\lambda_\ell,a,\theta_\text{t})\, {\text{d}}a \f]

    The representative asymmetry parameter \f$g_{\ell}\f$ is averaged over the scattering cross
    section and thus calculated using \f[ g_{\ell} = \frac{1}{\varsigma_{\ell}^{\text{sca}}} \sum_c
    \int_{a_{\text{min},c}}^{a_{\text{max},c}} \Omega_c(a)\, g_c(\lambda_\ell,a)\,
    Q^{\text{sca}}_c(\lambda_\ell,a)\, \pi a^2\, {\text{d}}a. \f]

    The dust mass per hydrogen atom \f$\mu\f$ is calculated by integrating the bulk density over
    the size distribution, \f[ \mu = \sum_c \int_{a_{\text{min},c}}^{a_{\text{max},c}} \Omega_c(a)\,
    \rho_{\text{bulk},c}\, \frac{4\pi}{3}\, a^3\, {\text{d}}a. \f]
