/** StochasticDustEmissionCalculator is a helper class to calculate the combined emissivity
    spectrum \f$\varepsilon_{\lambda}\f$ of a set of representative dust grain populations embedded
    in a given radiation field \f$J_\lambda\f$, taking into account the temperature distribution of
    stochastically heated dust grains (i.e. without assuming that the dust grains are in local
    thermal equilibrium) where appropriate.

    The class handles multiple representative grains that together describe a dust mixture. These
    are called \em bins because the calculator is typically used to handle the various grain size
    bins in a dust mix. The calculator assumes that, for each material type, the size distribution
    is discretized into a sufficient number of size bins. The calculator also requires access to
    enthalpy data for the various dust grain materials in the dust mix.

    A client of the class must first call the precalculate() function for each bin to supply the
    absorption cross sections and enthalpy data for the representative grain population
    corresponding to that bin. The emissivity() function can be used to obtain the combined
    emissivity spectrum for the representative grains in all bins. The embedding radiation field is
    specified by the mean intensities \f$(J_\lambda)_k\f$, which must be discretized on the
    simulation's radiation field wavelength grid as returned by the
    Configuration::radiationFieldWLG() function. The emissivity spectrum
    \f$(\varepsilon_\lambda)_\ell\f$ produced by the second function is discretized on the
    wavelength grid returned by the Configuration::dustEmissionWLG() function.

    Using the discretization of the dust composition and size distribution into a range of
    representative grains (size bins) and the output wavelength grid described above, in addition
    to a specialized temperature grid constructed by this class, the emissivity in an interstellar
    radiation field \f$J_\lambda\f$ can be written as \f[ \varepsilon_\lambda = \frac{1}{\mu}
    \sum_{b=0}^{N_{\text{size}}-1} \varsigma_{\lambda,b}^{\text{abs}}\,
    \sum_{i=0}^{N_{\text{temp}}-1} P_{b,i}\, B_\lambda(T_i) \f] with \f$\mu\f$ the total dust mass
    of the dust mix, \f$\varsigma_{\lambda,b}^{\text{abs}}\f$ the absorption cross section of the
    \f$b\f$'th size bin, \f$T_i\f$ the \f$i\f$'th temperature grid point, and \f$P_{b,i}\f$ the
    probability of finding a grain of the \f$b\f$'th size bin in the \f$i\f$'th temperature bin.

    The probabilities \f$P_{b,i}\f$ are calculated following a scheme based on Guhathakurta &
    Draine (ApJ 1989), Draine & Li (ApJ 2001), Kruegel (book, 2003), and Misselt et al. (arXiv,
    2008). The scheme is also nicely described by Verstappen (PhD thesis, 2013, section 2.5) and is
    summarized by Camps et al. (A\&A 2015). An overview is presented below. To simplify the
    notation we focus on a single representative dust grain, dropping the index \f$b\f$. Also note
    that the value of the radiation field is now obtained from the input wavelength grid.

    We define a transition matrix \f$A_{f,i}\f$ describing the probability per unit time for a
    grain to transfer from initial temperature bin \f$i\f$ to final temperature bin \f$f\f$. The
    transition matrix elements in the case of heating \f$(f>i)\f$ are given by \f[ A_{f,i} = 4\pi\,
    \varsigma_{\lambda_{fi}}^{\text{abs}}\,J_{\lambda_{fi}}\, \frac{hc\,\Delta H_f}{(H_f-H_i)^3}
    \f] where \f$H_f\f$ and \f$H_i\f$ are the enthalpies of the final and initial temperature bins,
    \f$\Delta H_f\f$ is the width of the final temperature bin, and \f$\lambda_{fi}\f$ is the
    transition wavelength which can be obtained from \f[ \lambda_{fi}=\frac{hc}{H_f-H_i}. \f] We
    assume that cooling transitions occur only to the next lower level, so that \f$A_{f,i}=0\f$ for
    \f$f<i-1\f$ and \f[ A_{i-1,i} = \frac{4\pi}{H_i-H_{i-1}}\, \int_0^\infty
    \varsigma_{\lambda}^{\text{abs}}\, B_{\lambda}(T_i)\, {\text{d}}\lambda. \f] The diagonal
    matrix elements are defined as \f[ A_{i,i} = -\sum_{f\ne i} A_{f,i}\f] however as we will see
    below there is no need to explicitly calculate these values.

    Assuming a steady state situation, the probabilities \f$P_{i}\f$ can be obtained from the
    transition matrix by solving the set of \f$N\f$ linear equations \f[ \sum_{i=0}^{N-1} A_{f,i}
    \,P_i=0 \qquad f=0,...,N-1 \f] along with the normalization condition \f[ \sum_{i=0}^{N-1} P_i
    = 1, \f] where \f$N\f$ is the number of temperature bins. Because the matrix values for
    \f$f<i-1\f$ are zero these equations can be solved by a recursive procedure of computational
    order \f${\mathcal{O}(N^2)}\f$. To avoid numerical instabilities caused by the negative
    diagonal elements, the procedure employs a well-chosen linear combination of the original
    equations. This leads to the following recursion relations for the adjusted matrix elements
    \f$B_{f,i}\f$, the unnormalized probabilities \f$X_i\f$, and finally the normalized
    probabilities \f$P_{i}\f$: \f{align*} B_{N-1,i} &= A_{N-1,i} & i=0,\ldots,N-2 \\ B_{f,i} &=
    B_{f+1,i}+A_{f,i} & f=N-2,\ldots,1;\,i=0,\ldots,f-1 \\ X_0 &= 1 \\ X_i &=
    \frac{\sum_{j=0}^{i-1}B_{i,j}X_j}{A_{i-1,i}} & i=1,\ldots,N-1 \\ P_i &=
    \frac{X_i}{\sum_{j=0}^{N-1}X_j} & i=0,\ldots,N-1 \f}

        specified as an argument.
