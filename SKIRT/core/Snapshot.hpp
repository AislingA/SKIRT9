/** Snapshot is an abstract base class for representing snapshot data that is imported from a
    column text file and is used to define the properties of primary sources or transfer media.
    This base class offers facilities to handle the input options, such as determining which
    columns are to be imported from the text file, and defines a common interface for all snapshot
    types, for example to obtain the density at a given position. The actual implementation must be
    provided in a derived class for each snapshot type.

    Some snapshot types use smoothed particles and some use spatial cells as their basic
    constituents. To avoid mentioning both, we use the generic term \em entity for referring to
    either particles or cells.

    A Snapshot instance must be initialized using the following strict calling sequence; calling
    any of the getters before the initialization sequence has completed results in undefined
    behavior:

      - open the input file by calling the open() function
      - configure the input file columns by calling the applicable importXXX() functions in the
        order the columns are expected to appear in the text file;
      - configure other options by calling the applicable setXXX() functions;
      - read the file calling the readAndClose() function.

    The functions for extracting information from a snapshot once it is loaded are thread-safe.
    However, the functions for configuring options and reading the snapshot file are \em not
    thread-safe; they must be called from a single thread (for each snapshot object). */

        before invoking any of the configuration functions(). This function takes several
        arguments: (1) \em item specifies a simulation item in the hierarchy of the caller (usually
        the caller itself) used to retrieve the input file path and an appropriate logger; (2) \em
        filename specifies the name of the file, including filename extension but excluding path
        and simulation prefix; (3) \em description describes the contents of the file for use in
        the log message issued after the file is successfully opened.

        The function is virtual so that subclasses can override it, for example to perform some
        initial configuration after opening but before client configuration occurs. */

        being imported and its value for a given entity is positive as well, and the imported
        temperature is above the maximum temperature, then the density corresponding to this entity
        is considered to be zero.

        using a mechanism that depends on the snapshot type and possibly on the configuration.
