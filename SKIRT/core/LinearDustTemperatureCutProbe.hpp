/** LinearDustTemperatureCutProbe outputs a column text file (named <tt>prefix_probe_T.dat</tt>)
    listing an indicative dust temperature along an arbitrary line segment throught the medium. The
    starting and ending point of the line segment can be configured using regular model
    coordinates, and the number of equidistant samples to be taken along the line can be specified
    as well. The resolution is limited only by the resolution of the simulation's spatial grid.

    The output file contains a line for each sample along the line segment. The first column
    specifies the distance along the line from the starting point, and the second column lists the
    indicative dust temperature.

    The indicative dust temperature for a particular sample position is obtained as follows. First
    the probe determines the cell in the simulation's spatial grid containing the position.
    For each material mix of type dust present in the cell, or if applicable, for each dust
    population in these mixes, the probe calculates the equilibrium temperature that would be
    reached when the dust is embedded in the radiation field tracked by the simulation for the
    cell. This is achieved by solving the energy balance equation under LTE (local thermal
    equilibrium) assumptions. The resulting temperatures are finally averaged over the dust
    populations in each mix (weighed by the relative mass in the mix) over and all dust components
    present in the spatial cell (weighed by relative mass in the cell).

    Note that the indicative dust temperature does not correspond to a physical temperature. The
    LTE assumption is almost certainly unjustified for a relevant portion of the dust grains
    (depending on the embedding radiation field), and even when ignoring this problem, averaging
    temperatures over dust populations and dust mixes has no clear-cut physical interpretation. */
