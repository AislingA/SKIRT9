/** The PhotonPacket class is used to describe photon packets, the basic luminosity packets that
    are transported during a radiative transfer simulation. Photon packets are monochromatic, i.e.
    they contain photons at a single wavelength. Apart from its luminosity, wavelength and
    polarization state, a photon packet carries information about its origin (e.g. emission by a
    primary or secondary source), about the interactions it experienced since its emission (e.g.
    the number of scattering events), and about its current path (e.g. starting position,
    propagation direction, list of dust cells being crossed). A photon packet also carries a unique
    identifier (within the current emission segment) for the \em history it is part of, i.e. the
    collection of scattered and peeled-off packets derived from the same originally launched packet
    (emitted by a primary or secondary source). This history index is used by some instruments to
    group the fluxes of all photon packets belonging to the same history.

    Because a photon packet's wavelength and/or frequency are retrieved much more frequently than
    updated, the PhotonPacket class has a data member for both both wavelength and frequency. The
    setters for wavelength and frequency immediately calculate and store both values, so that the
    getters can trivially return the stored value.

    Furthermore, a photon packet carries a specific luminosity rather than a luminosity. In line
    with common practice, we use \f$L_\nu(\lambda)\f$ expressed in units of W/Hz. An important
    benefit of this convention is that, when updating the frequency for a Doppler shift, the
    specific luminosity remains constant, because the frequency interval scales with the frequency.

    The current path and the polarization state are handled by publicly inheriting repectively the
    DustGridPath class and the StokesVector class. For performance reasons, a PhotonPacket object
    is usually constructed once at the start of a loop and then reused in the loop body for many
    consecutive launches; this allows the vectors with path information to remain allocated. Also,
    some trivial functions are implemented inline in the header. */
