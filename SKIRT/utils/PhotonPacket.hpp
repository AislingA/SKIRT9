/** The PhotonPacket class is used to describe monochromatic photon packets, the basic entities
    that are transported during a radiative transfer simulation. The fundamental properties of a
    photon packet include its \em wavelength and its \em weight. The wavelength property specifies
    the wavelength (or equivalenty, the frequency) of all photons in the packet. The weight
    property specifies the number of photons carried by the packet, or more precisely the number of
    photons per unit of time. Indeed, because we consider time-independent models, a photon packet
    actually represents a photon stream, consisting of a number of photons per unit of time. The
    weight can be fractional because it is derived from some arbitrary luminosity, and because it
    can be adjusted by arbitrary biasing factors during the photon packet's lifetime.

    Apart from its wavelength and weight, a photon packet carries information about its polarization
    state, about its origin (e.g. emission by a primary or secondary source), about the
    interactions it experienced since its emission (e.g. the number of scattering events), and
    about its current path (e.g. starting position, propagation direction, list of dust cells being
    crossed). A photon packet also carries a unique identifier (within the current emission
    segment) for the \em history it is part of, i.e. the collection of scattered and peeled-off
    packets derived from the same originally launched packet (emitted by a primary or secondary
    source). This history index can be used by instruments to group the fluxes of all photon
    packets belonging to the same history.

    Implementation notes
    --------------------

    For a given luminosity \f$L\f$ (representing the amount of energy carried by the photon packet
    per unit of time) and wavelength \f$\lambda=c/\nu\f$, the weight of the photon packet (i.e. the
    number of photons it carries per unit time) can be written as \f[ W = \frac{L}{h\nu} =
    \frac{L\lambda}{hc}. \f] To avoid multiplying and dividing by the constant factor \f$hc\f$,
    the weight tracked by a photon packet is instead simply defined as \f$W'=L\lambda\f$.

    The current path and the polarization state are handled by publicly inheriting repectively the
    DustGridPath class and the StokesVector class. For performance reasons, a PhotonPacket object
    is usually constructed once at the start of a loop and then reused in the loop body for many
    consecutive launches; this allows the vectors with path information to remain allocated. Also,
    some trivial functions are implemented inline in the header. */

        packet is ready to be launched through one of the launch() functions. The other functions

        photon packet object can be re-launched multiple times. */

        packet's history index, the wavelength of its photons, the source luminosity represented by
        the packet, its starting position, and its propagation direction. The function calculates
        the weight corresponding to the specified luminosity and wavelength, copies the remaining
        arguments to the corresponding data members and initializes the other data members as
        described below.

        If the RedshiftInterface is specified (i.e. it is not the null pointer), then the packet's
        wavelength is redshifted corresponding to its emission direction. If the
        PolarizationStateInterface is specified, the packet's polarization state is set according
        to its emission direction; otherwise the polarization state is set to unpolarized. The
        AngularDistributionInterface is not used by this function, but pointers to all three
        interfaces are stored in data members for use by the launchEmissionPeelOff() function.

        If the base packet has a RedshiftInterface (i.e. if it is not the null pointer), then the
