/** The PhotonPacket class is used to describe monochromatic photon packets, the basic entities
    that are transported during a radiative transfer simulation. The fundamental properties of a
    photon packet include its \em frequency and its \em weight. The frequency property specifies
    the frequency (or equivalenty, the wavelength) of all photons in the packet. The weight
    property specifies the number of photons carried by the packet, or more precisely the number of
    photons per unit of time. Indeed, because we consider time-independent models, a photon packet
    actually represents a photon stream, consisting of a number of photons per unit of time. The
    weight can be fractional because it is derived from some arbitrary luminosity, and because it
    can be adjusted by arbitrary biasing factors during the photon packet's lifetime.

    Apart from its frequency and weight, a photon packet carries information about its polarization
    state, about its origin (e.g. emission by a primary or secondary source), about the
    interactions it experienced since its emission (e.g. the number of scattering events), and
    about its current path (e.g. starting position, propagation direction, list of dust cells being
    crossed). A photon packet also carries a unique identifier (within the current emission
    segment) for the \em history it is part of, i.e. the collection of scattered and peeled-off
    packets derived from the same originally launched packet (emitted by a primary or secondary
    source). This history index can be used by instruments to group the fluxes of all photon
    packets belonging to the same history.

    Because a photon packet's wavelength and/or frequency are retrieved much more frequently than
    updated, the PhotonPacket class has a data member for both both wavelength and frequency. The
    setters for wavelength and frequency immediately calculate and store both values, so that the
    getters can trivially return the stored value.

    The current path and the polarization state are handled by publicly inheriting repectively the
    DustGridPath class and the StokesVector class. For performance reasons, a PhotonPacket object
    is usually constructed once at the start of a loop and then reused in the loop body for many
    consecutive launches; this allows the vectors with path information to remain allocated. Also,
    some trivial functions are implemented inline in the header. */
